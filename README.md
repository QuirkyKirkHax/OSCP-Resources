# OSCP-Resources
notes and ramblings from my OSCP/PenTesting Studies

I can't imagine this will be particularly helpful/useful, but I am sharing my notes here for anyone who wants 'em.

Note that there may be references to outside materials, and language may be coarse at times.  I wasn't really planning on sharing these until some folks asked....So forgive me.
