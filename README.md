# OSCP-Resources
notes and ramblings from my OSCP/PenTesting Studies

I can't imagine this will be particularly helpful/useful, but I am sharing my notes here for anyone who wants 'em.

The .ctb file is for use with Cherrytree, which is where I did the vast majority of my note taking...If someone wants to convert it to obsidian or something, be my guest...

Note that there may be references to outside materials, and language may be coarse at times.  I wasn't really planning on sharing these until some folks asked....So forgive me.
